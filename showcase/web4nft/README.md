Web4 NFT
========

[contract.js](./contract.js) contains a sample Javascript customization of a Rust NFT contract. Note that the web4 frontend contents is base64 encoded in the `index_html_base64` variable. So in order to change the page served from web4 you should encode [index.html](index.html) as base64.
